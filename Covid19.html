        <h3><p><center>Covid-19 pandemic is getting worse in every country including our country, Malaysia. If you have been following the pandemic news in our country, you will know that the number of confirmed cases is increasing every day. Even though there are many people who will follow the instructions given by our government, there are still people who don't care about the rules. As a result, the epidemic in our country cannot be controlled in the shortest possible time and it is getting worse. Our country's resources are being depleted because of this pandemic, and all the medical staff are working day and night to treat the patients. So we hope that this website will make more people aware of the importance of preventive measures. We will include correct steps for how to wear a mask properly and the correct way for handwashing. We will also include the latest news from Kementerian Kesihatan Malaysia (KKM) during this pandemic to let people know how the pandemic is going on. Not only that, we will include hospitalsâ€™ hotline and steps to diagnose symptoms for covid. We will indicate that all information on this website is true. All people are urged not to believe false information that is not by KKM. Our web page will have the simplest design possible. For example, we will use videos and photos to express the message we would like to bring out. This is because if we use complex words to express the information, it will be boring to the people who visit our web page. Videos and photos will allow people to receive the information in the simplest and most direct way.</center> </p></h3>
